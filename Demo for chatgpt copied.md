Got it 👍 Here’s a **concise step-by-step guide** for using **Obsidian with Markdown (`.md`) files**:

---

## 🔹 1. Install & Setup

1. Download [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for your OS.
2. On first launch, choose:

   * **Create a vault** → New folder for your notes.
   * **Open folder as vault** → Select an existing folder with `.md` files.

---

## 🔹 2. Basic Usage

* Obsidian works directly with plain `.md` files.
* Each note = one Markdown file stored in your vault folder.
* You can also edit them with any text editor outside Obsidian.

---

## 🔹 3. Writing Notes (Markdown Basics)

* **Headings**: `# H1`, `## H2`, `### H3`
* **Bold**: `**text**`
* **Italic**: `*text*`
* **Lists**:

  * Unordered: `- item`
  * Ordered: `1. item`
* **Links**: `[Google](https://google.com)`
* **Images**: `![alt](image.png)`
* **Code**:

  * Inline: `` `code` ``
  * Block:

    ````
    ```language
    code here
    ```
    ````

## 🔹 4. Obsidian Features

* **Internal Links**: `[[Note Name]]` → Links to another note in your vault.
* **Tags**: `#tagname` → Group related notes.
* **Graph View**: See connections between notes visually.
* **Backlinks Panel**: Shows where a note is referenced.

---

## 🔹 5. File Management

* Notes are just `.md` files in your vault folder.
* You can rename, move, or back them up with Git, Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.
* Works seamlessly across devices if you sync the folder.

---

## 🔹 6. Plugins & Customization

* Core plugins: Daily Notes, Templates, Backlinks.
* Community plugins: Task management, Kanban boards, Zotero integration, etc.
* Themes: Change look via **Settings → Appearance**.

---

## 🔹 7. Workflow Tips

* Use `[[links]]` instead of nested folders for flexible organization.
* Create **MOCs (Maps of Content)** → index notes that link to many related notes.
* Use **search (`Ctrl+Shift+F`)** and tags to quickly find notes.

👉 That’s it! Obsidian is just a smart layer on top of Markdown files. You own your data, and everything stays portable.

Do you want me to also make you a **ready-to-use starter vault structure** (folders + sample `.md` templates) so you can kick off faster?
